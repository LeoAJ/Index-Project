### Intro:
In this project, I will have a very large text file with lots of actors and actresses name and movies that he or she starred in, I build a basic hash index in dictionary structure with Python to increase the searching efficient of this gigantic text file. Because the normal search needs to take 1 second for exactly 1 character, which is too slow.
